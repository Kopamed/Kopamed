### üõ†Ô∏è Skills
Below is a summary of my skills and the duration of my experience with them:

- **Python** - from June 2017: Everything and anything
- **JavaScript (JS)** - since May 2017: Browser extensions and plugins
- **HTML + CSS** - since May 2017: I have never made a good looking web page in pure HTML and CSS
- **jQuery** - from August 2017: Didn't make it into my stack
- **Java** - since May 2021: Minecraft mods... but also many other projects because I really love java and the "everything is an object" ideology
- **Java deobfuscation and bytecode** from August 2021 to May 2022: 0xCAFEBABE
- **TensorFlow** - since February 2022: And so it begins
- **React** - from September 2023: React is react
- **Tailwind** - since September 2023: Made frontend go from torture to therapy
- **Next.js** - since November 2023: Can't stand svelte fanboys
- **TypeScript (TS)** - from September 2023: Looks better than js and it reminds me of java
- **React Native + Expo** - from March 2024: Roses are red, violets are blue, I should study for exams, but there's a new SDK to review.
- **JAX + FLAX + OPTAX** - from April 2024: I want to go a level deeper than tensorflow.
- **Supabase** - from June 2024: How is this the only decent BaaS that provides templates for react native that actually work and don't require an hour of debugging to get it half working???
- **Docker** - from August 2024: Used to be a hater but it is growing on me.
- **AWS** - from August 2024: Addicted to the cloud

I've also worked with a load of other languages, frameworks and libraries... so many that I can't remember half of them... I have forgotten them because I couldn't find any ongoing applications for them.
