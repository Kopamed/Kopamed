### üõ†Ô∏è Skills
Below is a summary of my skills and the duration of my experience with them:

- **Python** - from June 2017: Just everything and anything
- **JavaScript (JS)** - since May 2017: Making stupid browser extensions and plugins
- **HTML + CSS** - since May 2017: I have never made a good looking web page in pure HTML and CSS
- **jQuery** - from August 2017: Very useful for ugly half-finished websites which I forget about after 2 days
- **Java** - since May 2021: Minecraft mods... but also general stuff because I really love java and the "everything is an object" ideology
- **Java deobfuscation and bytecode** from August 2021 to May 2022: 0xCAFEBABE
- **TensorFlow** - since February 2022: Idk when in doubt just slap your problem with some ML
- **React** - from September 2023: React is react
- **Tailwind** - since September 2023: Made frontend go from torture to therapy
- **Next.js** - since November 2023: Can't stand svelte fanboys
- **TypeScript (TS)** - from September 2023: Idk it just looks better than js and it reminds me of java
- **React Native + Expo** - from March 2024: Roses are red, violets are blue, I should study for exams, but there's a new SDK to review.
- **JAX + FLAX + OPTAX** - from April 2024: I want to go a level deeper than tensorflow.
- **Supabase** - from June 2024: How is this the only decent BaaS that provides templates for react native that actually work and don't require an hour of debugging to get it half working???

I've also worked with a load of other languages, frameworks and libraries... so many that I can't remember half of them... I have forgotten them because I couldn't find any ongoing applications for them.
